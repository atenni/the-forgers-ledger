# The Forgers' Ledger

**The Forgers' Ledger** is a daily-scraped tracker of the global hunt for 400
hidden coins from _The Forger's Ledger_, a collaborative project by Thom
Yorke and Mark Pritchard. The coins are being discovered and logged via
[forger.tall-tales.info](https://forger.tall-tales.info), and this repository
maps that progress over time.
